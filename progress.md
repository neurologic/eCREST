129 cells in the network that fall within cell types of interest (nodes in the graph):

29 lf cells.
26 lg cells.
35 mg1 cells.
31 mg2 cells.
3 lx cells.
5 mgx cells.

28 total cells have post-synaptic segments labeled for their synapses
1630 total post-synapstic segments labeled from mg cells in the network
43 mg cells without labeled synapses

> 253 unique edges among:
> 28 unique pre synaptic cells - to - 117 unique post-synaptic cells (counts different structures on same cell as different)

> 995 synapses with reconstructed partners in current network,
995 synapses with reconstructed partners from mg cells pre-synaptically.
13 mg1 cells with 
418 connected synapses with a reconstructed partner in these mg1

453 unique edges among:
46 unique pre synaptic cells - to - 141 unique post-synaptic cells (counts different structures on same cell as different)

> So, instead of there being more post-syn not reconstructed, new synapses are tending to connect to already reconstructed cells at this point?
