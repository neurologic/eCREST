> So, instead of there being more post-syn not reconstructed, new synapses are tending to connect to already reconstructed cells at this point?

figured out the large synaptic weight partnerships were because of duplicate files (not duplicate reconstructions, but rather same cell_id, older files)... but confused why cell counts changed... this should not be effected by duplicates of same cell id
also removed an mg2 cell type and changed to mgx...
